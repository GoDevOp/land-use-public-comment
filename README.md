# land-use-public-comment

Land Use Public Comment is a configuration of ArcGIS and a JavaScript application that allows the general public and other interested parties to comment on proposed land-use cases being heard by their local government from a smartphone, tablet, and desktop computer.

Land Use Public Comment can be used by planning and zoning, building, or other local government organizations to deliver a web-based public comment application. This application provides 24/7 access to an organization and typically supplements statutory public notice requirements.
